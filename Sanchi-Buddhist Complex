<h1> Sanchi-The Land of Buddha </h1>
<h3> <img src="download.jpeg">
<p> Sanchi is a Buddhist complex on a hilltop at Sanchi Town in Raisen District of the State of Madhya Pradesh, India. 
</p>

<h3> Brief History of the Great Stupa of Sanchi </h3>

<p>
It was originally commissioned by the Mauryan emperor Ashoka the Great in the 3rd century BCE. Its nucleus was a simple hemispherical brick structure built over the relics of the Buddha.
</p>
<p>
The original construction work of this stupa was overseen by Ashoka, whose wife Devi was the daughter of a merchant of nearby Vidisha. Sanchi was also her birthplace as well as the venue of her and Ashoka's wedding. In the 1st century BCE, four elaborately carved toranas and a balustrade encircling the entire structure were added.
